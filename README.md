	-various ingredients (soap, air, extra things (paint, SHARP ROCKS, filled with multitudes of tadpoles)
	-each ingredient adds (or removes) from base hp, speed, attack??
	-pit them against each other--toss them in an arena where they just bounce around
		-initial speed and direction
		-every change in direction (from hitting a wall or the other bubble) reduces health
